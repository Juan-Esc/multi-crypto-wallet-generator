# Multi-Cryptocurrency Wallet Generator

This project generates Ethereum, Bitcoin and DeSo wallet addresses using a mnemonic phrase. It utilizes the BIP39 library for mnemonic phrase generation and HD key derivation for both Ethereum and Bitcoin/DeSo wallets. The generated addresses include both the public and private keys for each wallet, enabling users to manage their assets across multiple cryptocurrencies.

Note: Keep your mnemonic phrase and private keys confidential. Anyone with access to them can steal your cryptocurrency.
